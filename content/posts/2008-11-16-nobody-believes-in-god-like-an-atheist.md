> But the atheist, you see — the man who advertises his disbelief in god — is a very pious person. Nobody believes in god like an atheist. ‘There is no god, and I am his prophet.’

_Alan Watts_

I&#8217;ve always thought that Richard Dawkins and his followers have an evangelical air about them, confirmed by the &#8216;Atheist Ad Campaign&#8217;.

I mean if religion is a bad thing, then why drag yourself down to their level? Who cares what other people believe, surely it&#8217;s a personal thing? What happened to &#8216;live and let live&#8217;?

I&#8217;ll support their right to say it till the last breath in my body, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that this kind of piety in the name of no-god is ultimately a healthy thing.

If you subscribe to the [Alan Watts Podcast][1] and download &#8216;Religion of No Religion #1&#8242; then you can hear more of Mr. Watts&#8217; views on atheism.
