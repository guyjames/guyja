  Regenerative Villages, land backed DAOs/DHOs, and a few paths forwards for SEEDS

---

Rieki is the co-founder of the [SEEDS project](https://joinseeds.earth) which is a community dedicated to the regeneration of the biosphere by means of coordination through Web3 tools (and Web2, there is a Discord and Telegram too).

We go into where SEEDS is at now as a project and the new regenerative villages initiative and its implications, communities vs economies, work vs inspiration, and so on.

Thanks to Rieki for a very interesting conversation! Hopefully we can do another one soon and I will link up my decent camera and mic rather than using the built-in ones on my old Thinkpad.
